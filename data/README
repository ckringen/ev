Ok, here are the data for you to play with. The only thing that we still need (Martin will send this shortly)
is info on which subjects are native speakers vs. not, but you can get started without this info
(there will only be a few non-native speakers).

The columns in the attached file are as follows:
>
>>>     --Subject ID (MTurk ID; 600 unique values, with 50 lines per subject)
>>>     --Sentence (Item) Num (this field has a value of 1 through 150; these values correspond to the numbers of the 150 original sentences; any given subject only saw 50 of the items)
>>>     --List Num (this field has a value of 1, 2, 3, or 4; these values correspond to the four experimental lists; this value is the same for all the rows of any given subject)
>>>     --Subset Num (this field has a value of 1, 2, or 3; these values correspond to the subset number; this value is the same for all the rows of any given subject)
>>>     --Trial Num (this field has a value of 1 through 50 and indicates the order in which the subject got the 50 sentences in their set)
NB: The expt description I sent earlier should help interpret the columns above.

>>>     --Target sentence (the original sentence)
>>>     --Scrambled version presented to the participant
>>>     --Produced sentence (the subject's attempt to make a sentence out of the scrambled version)
>>>     --Time (in ms)
>>>     --Time (in min and sec)
--Bugged (this field has a value 'Safe' or 'Bugged'; a small num of trials were not presented right; we'll want to ignore the trials where this field=Bugged in all the analyses)

Please let me know if anything is unclear!

Look forward to hearing about what you find,
